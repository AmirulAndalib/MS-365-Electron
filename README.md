# Introduction

This project is basically a Desktop wrapper for the web version of [Microsoft 365](https://microsoft365.com), which is free but with some basic limits.

I initially made this project because I wanted to use Microsoft 365 on my Linux machine, so to get the feel of using a native app while using it on Linux, I thought to made this project. Later, I decided to make it public so that others can enjoy this too!

Don't expect this to be a full-fledged Microsoft 365 Desktop Suite (like we have for Windows/macOS), it's just a wrapper of the web version of Microsoft 365.
