# Introduction

This project is basically a Desktop wrapper for the web version of [Microsoft 365](https://microsoft365.com), which is free but with some basic limits.

I initially made this project because I wanted to use Microsoft 365 on my Linux system with a native experience. Later, I decided to make it public so that others can enjoy this too!

Don't expect this to be a full-fledged Microsoft 365 Desktop Suite (like we have for Windows/macOS), it's just a wrapper of the web version of Microsoft 365.

Note - Windows Hello or Sign in with Security key is **not** supported and will show you an error. You will have to manually sign in with your E-Mail and Password.

***Do Expect bugs***
